            "we are looking for the size of your taking a nap dot can you see my screen continue can you see my hello Google asking for another step now you can see my screen we have a steps we had sex like this like I'm writing the things again I don't know yet when the number of elements in equal 88 / 8 / 2 and then 4 / 4 and then 8 / 2 - 1 Linden equals in equal 16 168 / 2 and then we'll be at this time calculator and then we have a game 8 / 2 - 1 and then the 16 / 2 - 5 minutes 16 / 28 / 2.48 / 2 - 1 16/2 - 1 and then we have one 168 168 288 + 28 - 3 that is 25 285 325 98 + 25 334 333 + 4 + 7 + 20 579 367 this is true about K-2 who's the public a minus 3 - 3 and this is 2 ^ 2 series like this with the power Street this series of the series we are having in this site that is the summer 664 Google and you can write that one these terms that these terms to take only this particular part of them you have that two times 32 * 5 * 7.00 now let's see how to write that letter let's see write how to write that letter Mercedes to the power to 8 - 1 + 4 - 2 + 1 come down to dot dot dot 2 to the power to and plus that Constantine 4 like that you will go down to 20% of that this will become two types of that yeah so we can write separately now let's see what is the result and this will become do you multiply it by this one to the power 324 422.55 and now we have some kind of representation losses Sarah how many you want to see the first one yes how many to in equal 4175 or maybe Kmart cake cake cake cake -227 - 2 - 2 that is how can we find the summation of geometrical Series right summation of geometrical series you can write write an equation summation of geometrical series 8 hours 2 + 2802 despacito 2 maybe some kind of a number 566 situation the geometrical series we can write in terms of getting back up a and 1 - RN + 1 the number of terms number of terms in then you have one here it is if you start going to snow tomorrow is to the power 2 and 1 - 2 ^ 2 K 1 - 2 ^ 3 + 1 - 2 that is how you are getting the results so we can write it is -1 / 1 * 3 now here is going to be to the power 2 hours to in is going to be and he's going to be k-102 in equals 2 did they do any mistake here and it was K - 2200 who are the Republican -182 / 2 minutes - 1 825 what is this song go to the public a plus one means inside Escape 222 K - 2/3 - -1 - 2 - 2 - 2 + 2 - 2/5 okay -2 k + 2 + 4 + 2 is -122 negative two negative negative Okay negative this is going to be what is going to be longer size and here we have obtained the pattern and then from that time he came to the final size in this week final size industry I need an answer zombie cancel cancel it right now that is the equation calculator the size is to win -12 now let's see how to calculate what is the date today mistakes earlier we had the food in equal 8504 if you have skip skip indicate plus 4 8 4 4 equals 60 466 this is 864 866 can you see now yes right now I go from 8:33 1664 and this is 66 326 568 647 when we remove that too from here how much is it to this is 4 this is 666 this is going to be 8 right 6:00 a.m. out here this is 225253 or 32445668 OK Google let me remove these two the first step is 2 ^ 10 - 250 - 2 486 how many multiples are available that is the case we have to identify if you look at that pattern if you look at that time okay that number how many none of us two types of that two types of that how many steps are there so that is what we have to understand in that situation we can see here now how many how many times you have to divide 664 3 times 4 times 5 how many times you have to divide this end to make it so that who's the father kid divided by the power a minus 275 326 K - 2 * 4.2 is 8 800 - 2 sorry A minus 2 minus 265 K minus two names are here the case for 4-2 is 22 * 6 don't forget about this one right now 16 the case is 55 - 2 is 333 666 + 2 minutes 2 minutes now we have an equation know what is there actually logins login so then we can write two login Facebook who is -1 + 2 login Facebook 1020 supposed to have 4,096 - 227 28 - login now if you have any questions this is the time you ask your questions if you have any questions please raise your questions now any questions any questions for the machine machine we don't have access but this Friday I will I will take the baby at least 1 hour session I want to know whether you are familiar with the Unix command to work on remotely are you familiar with that one before you go into the industry at least we can give you this account we have to deal with you next month hello how to compile a c program those type of stuff everyday and how do you spell editors and already know anything else so I will create some accounts on the flashlight Friday morning right Friday morning 8:59 will take maybe around 1:01 or 2:10 \n"
